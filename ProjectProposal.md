# Project proposal for *LendingClub user loan payoff prediction*
Author: *Amir Abbaspour*

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 1pt
The banks need to have an accurate model to see whether they should give someone loan or not. This project can give me an experience of working with real data. In addition, I am interested in neural networks and would like to compare the performance and runtime of other machine learning algorithms with it.

## 2. How: Plan of attack 1pt
The goal of this project is to develop a few models (1 Neural network and 1 or 2 classifications from SKlearn) that can accuretly predict the chance of loan payoff of a user. The models will be at least a classification model along with neural network model.

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts
I am planning on working with a small subset of the big data of LendingClub dataset. The dataset is collected from www.lendingclub.com. 

- LendingClub dataset from ```https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club``` (121 columns in the dataset that some will be used in this project, A subset of 400,000 samples)
- At least one Scikit-learn classifiers from LogisticRegression, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, SVC
- Along with Neural Network
